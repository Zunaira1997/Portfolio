                <h3>Building my portfolio</h3>
                <p>This portfolio is not only representing my work and experiences it is also personifying me, the users
                    of this website must recognise how professional is the developer of the website.</p>
                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>In my research I have used google search and GitHub to find the specialized portfolios from the most
                    experienced people. During my research I made a list of the things and unique ideas I liked in
                    different portfolio sites which I could also code to include in my site or come up with something
                    unique such as creating a different flow in each section.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Inspiration and Ideas </em>
                <p>
                    One of the portfolios in my research I have adored is from GitHub of Melissa Perez
                    who is also a website developer.
                </p>
                <!-- Screen shot of Perez, M. website -->

                <var><small><a href="https://melissaperez.dev">Perez, M.</a> website (2019).</small></var>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons why I like the portfolio it is professional, classy, attentive and clear
                    touch of details. Melissa has developed an eye-catching portfolio as you open the site the first
                    thing you see is the animated banner an optional button to play music on the right-hand side of the
                    navigation. The features on her website is very interesting and Melissa has coded each section
                    differently, moreover it seems like she knows her target audience very well as she added animates
                    which creates an impressive technique look.
                </p>
                <h4>Development process</h4>
                <p>
                    Planning the portfolio according to the brief is a good idea as you can easily plan your steps
                    without falling apart. I have planned each page following the given brief and before coding or
                    staring my website design I planned to write down the data that I wanted on my website. For example,
                    the about me section is from my CV which I had written a few weeks before and the blogs were written
                    during the lectures with my lecturers who reviewed the blogs to confirm if they are suitable to go
                    on the portfolio, then the portfolio section was just linking my pass work and including a few
                    sentences on how they are relevant and any benefits. Over the development process I had to make
                    decisions and choices such as designing on either a classic website or a colourful lively site, it
                    was a hard choice as I was feeling both, so I found the middle way out by following few rules of
                    making an effective website. I have used clean design, simple, responsive, added pictures, effective
                    written content, decent colours, easy to navigate, focused and highlighted contact information.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Images</em>
                <p>
                    The images I have used are my own and they do not need any copyright, the reason for using images of
                    building and unrelated stuff is because these are from my Creative Media project coursework from the
                    second year. I really enjoy photography, and I want to develop this talent, so I have chosen some of
                    my favourite shots to help illustrate my site and show my skills.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Tools & Techniques</em>
                <p>
                    I have used resourceful tools and techniques to design the portfolio such as the wireframe sketches
                    and moodboard to help me decide the type of theme or structure will stand out on my portfolio to
                    reflect my personality. I have gone for a black and white theme colours with a touch of bright pink
                    colour to highlight few areas such as the navigation bar, however there is a use of transparency and
                    transparent colours which gives the site a reflective glass appearing look. It is a responsive site
                    which can be used on Desk-top, Tablet and phone too, to make the website design responsive I have
                    used HTML and CSS to automatically shrink, enlarge, hide or resized to fit on all devices.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Responsive portfolio </em>
                <p>
                    To create a responsive portfolio here are the practical steps I have taken, I have used flexbox to
                    prevent the layout from floating round on the device by aligning and justifying items on the main it
                    keeps the content structured in a box by distributing space between flex items. I have also used
                    media queries, optimized images, considered mobile first design, responsive layout and CSS grid.
                </p>
