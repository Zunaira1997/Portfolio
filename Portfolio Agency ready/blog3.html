                <h3>Performance and optimization</h3>
                <h4>Code</h4>
                <p>Coding can be very complicated or it can be simply easy, depends on the coder what techniques they
                    use. I like to keep my coding clean, structured and easy to understand, I like every section to be
                    named and commented. As people tend to forget what they were doing so it better to nama every
                    section accordingly and I have named my sections,class, counters according to the semantics of my
                    HTML marked up content. I started my coding using HTML5 tags including DOCTYPE declaration, meta
                    tags, semantic elements and graphic elements such as svg to create animated vector based graphic. It
                    was my first time using graphic elements which was quite interesting discovering I could create an
                    animated arrow using svg and @keyframes. While writing HTML/CSS I was concentrating on coding
                    sections that float and layout perfectly, I messed up quite a few times but finally I fixed the
                    coding using the flex flow and wrap. However, I was mostly concerned about making the website
                    responsive to fit on mobile screen, setting viewport meta tag and adding screen media using HTML/CSS
                    to automatically resize, hide, shrink, and enlarge solved my problem.

                <h4>Optimization</h4>
                <p>
                    To ensure my site loads fast I have optimised all my images to reduce the file size and compress the
                    images without losing huge amount of quality. Larger file sizes made my website speed slower and
                    every image would take a few seconds to load which resulted in my website loading for amount of time
                    after optimizing the images there was a great amount of change which also increased the speed of the
                    website. To compress JPEG files, I used two sites Squoosh and TintJPG both sites were free and fast
                    but squoosh was complicated and the end results did not satisfy me, on the other hand TintJPG was
                    simple and seemed more reliable. TinyJPG reduced the file size of my JPEG images, all the uploaded
                    images were analyzed and applied the best possible JPEG encoding. Based on the content of my images
                    an optimal strategy was chosen automatically, the result is a quality images without wasting storage
                    or bandwidth.

                <h4> SEO integration</h4>
                <p>
             To achieve long-lasting, quality results, Search engine optimization needs to be integrated. SEO is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine.To make sure my website is easy to find and my audience are on the right website I have named the website as Zunaira, of course there can be more than one Zunaira with similarities so I decided to add a unique Favicon with my initial. The title for every page is different, and I have added meta tags with descriptions and keywords describing every page.

                <p>
                    My main technical issues were to create a responsive site that fits on all the devices. for the
                    sections that did not work well with one or two layouts I have employed 3 layouts/ media screen
                    queries for different screen widths .
                </P>

                <img src="img/responsive.png" alt="Responsive layout sizes">
                <br> <strong>Small:</strong> Media screen max-width 600px
                <br><strong>Medium:</strong> Media screen max-width 600px - 800px
                <br><strong>Large:</strong> Media screen max-width over 800px
                <P> Although these layouts include the same font elements and graphics but they are designed to display
                    the content based on the screen.
