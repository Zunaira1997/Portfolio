                <em class="attribution">Being a woman in the technology industry</em>
                <p>
                    Being the woman in tech industry gives you all sorts of feelings innovative to lonely. This is one
                    reason why I questioned myself in the first year of my Website development course “Why am I doing
                    the male based course? or why aren't there more women?”, I think the reason for these questions was
                    clear because there were only 3 female fellow students including myself in a course full of
                    boys/male students. Sometimes the gender split can make huge difference on your learning experience.
                    However, that didn’t stop me from undertaking what I wanted to achieve in fact It made me feel
                    strong, proud and unique. Here I am now in my final year compeleting my degree and I am looking
                    forward to make changes in the tech industry by being the ‘tech woman’ and looking to inspire the
                    new generation. </p>

                <em class="attribution">My inspiration</em>
                <p>During my second year I was inspired by successful females in technology industry
                    such as Laura Soutar, who is a Software Engineer, Civica Digital. As I searched up ‘Being woman in
                    the technology industry’ Laura’s blog showed
                    up where she has effectively written here story of being the woman in technology and how she has
                    made her way through and how that changed her
                    and how she sees the world. Laura say’s “we should highlight more women in the media and education
                    system so that they can act as role models”
                    (<a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/woman-in-the-technology/58755/">Open Access
                        Government</a>, 2019), here she is speaking on encouraging the women and women's rights in the
                    industry, more females we encourage to
                    take a step forward, more mentors we have for the young girls to be inspired and lead. Women's
                    rights in the industry like maternity leave and
                    financial support or a female wanting to start a family while continuing to work, these have small
                    changes have already taken part in many
                    countries which is good news but in the technology industry I believe we need to bring paternity
                    benefits up to scratch and this is my aim in
                    the industry development.</p>

                <h4>Industry statistic</h4>
                <p> 4.3 billion internet users Globally, approximately 1.94 billion active websites in the world, even
                    the small businesses have websites reached 64% in 2019, 66 percent of people prefer to read
                    beautifully designed content, mobile devices account for nearly 2 of every 3 minutes spent online
                    and 90% of people use multiple screens sequentially
                    (<a href="https://techjury.net/">Tech Jury</a>, 2019). All these facts are representing the
                    importance of website developers and designers in the tech industry. The industry is developing, and
                    we have a new generation stepping forward with great new ideas. 64% of the smaller business decided
                    to grow their business online by developing a website, of course the website makes a huge difference
                    to a business and many organizations started from a small online business to a worldwide known
                    manufacturer.

                </p>
                <em class="attribution">My future career</em>
                <p>As a website development student, I am looking forward to my future career in the Tech industry in
                    this country because the “UK tech scaleup investment makes up 80% of total tech investment in the
                    UK. This puts the UK in a strong international position to continue creating tech unicorns, and
                    driving job creation up through high growth company activity” (<a
                        href="https://technation.io/report2019/#11-scaleup-investment/">Tech Nation</a>, 2019).</p>
                <em class="attribution">Employment in the city</em>
                <p> According to the Tech Nation report “The recent growth rate for London tech scaleups at 56% makes
                    the cluster first in the world for scaleup growth”
                    (<a href="https://technation.io/report2019/#key-statistics">Tech Nation</a>, 2019). Which means
                    there is a higher chance for people living in London to get the positions and for people like myself
                    living in Manchester might have to move to London to achieve the success. This affects me as an
                    individual who is not planning to move out to another city as this could disturb my family life.
                    However, in the future approximately in few years I believe I can look up for a change in the
                    industrial growth rate in Manchester, because Manchester is a city of students and new talented
                    employees and graduates connected to technology industry will soon make the change, as we all are
                    striving for growth and success.

                <h3>Building my portfolio</h3>
                <p>This portfolio is not only representing my work and experiences it is also personifying me, the users
                    of this website must recognise how professional is the developer of the website.</p>
                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>In my research I have used google search and GitHub to find the specialized portfolios from the most
                    experienced people. During my research I made a list of the things and unique ideas I liked in
                    different portfolio sites which I could also code to include in my site or come up with something
                    unique such as creating a different flow in each section.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Inspiration and Ideas </em>
                <p>
                    One of the portfolios in my research I have adored is from GitHub of Melissa Perez
                    who is also a website developer.
                </p>
                <!-- Screen shot of Perez, M. website -->
                <a href="https://melissaperez.dev"><img src="img/melissa.jpg" alt="Perez, M. website" width="500"
                        height="290"></a>

                <p>
                    There are many reasons why I like the portfolio it is professional, classy, attentive and clear
                    touch of details. Melissa has developed an eye-catching portfolio as you open the site the first
                    thing you see is the animated banner an optional button to play music on the right-hand side of the
                    navigation. The features on her website is very interesting and Melissa has coded each section
                    differently, moreover it seems like she knows her target audience very well as she added animates
                    which creates an impressive technique look.
                </p>
                <h4>Development process</h4>
                <p>
                    Planning the portfolio according to the brief is a good idea as you can easily plan your steps
                    without falling apart. I have planned each page following the given brief and before coding or
                    staring my website design I planned to write down the data that I wanted on my website. For example,
                    the about me section is from my CV which I had written a few weeks before and the blogs were written
                    during the lectures with my lecturers who reviewed the blogs to confirm if they are suitable to go
                    on the portfolio, then the portfolio section was just linking my pass work and including a few
                    sentences on how they are relevant and any benefits. Over the development process I had to make
                    decisions and choices such as designing on either a classic website or a colourful lively site, it
                    was a hard choice as I was feeling both, so I found the middle way out by following few rules of
                    making an effective website. I have used clean design, simple, responsive, added pictures, effective
                    written content, decent colours, easy to navigate, focused and highlighted contact information.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Images</em>
                <p>
                    The images I have used are my own and they do not need any copyright, the reason for using images of
                    building and unrelated stuff is because these are from my Creative Media project coursework from the
                    second year. I really enjoy photography, and I want to develop this talent, so I have chosen some of
                    my favourite shots to help illustrate my site and show my skills.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Tools & Techniques</em>
                <p>
                    I have used resourceful tools and techniques to design the portfolio such as the wireframe sketches
                    and moodboard to help me decide the type of theme or structure will stand out on my portfolio to
                    reflect my personality. I have gone for a black and white theme colours with a touch of bright pink
                    colour to highlight few areas such as the navigation bar, however there is a use of transparency and
                    transparent colours which gives the site a reflective glass appearing look. It is a responsive site
                    which can be used on Desk-top, Tablet and phone too, to make the website design responsive I have
                    used HTML and CSS to automatically shrink, enlarge, hide or resized to fit on all devices.
                </p>
                <em class="attribution">Responsive portfolio </em>
                <p>
                    To create a responsive portfolio here are the practical steps I have taken, I have used flexbox to
                    prevent the layout from floating round on the device by aligning and justifying items on the main it
                    keeps the content structured in a box by distributing space between flex items. I have also used
                    media queries, optimized images, considered mobile first design, responsive layout and CSS grid.
                </p>

                <h3>Performance and optimization</h3>
                <h4>Code</h4>
                <p>Coding can be very complicated or it can be simply easy, depends on the coder what techniques they
                    use. I like to keep my coding clean, structured and easy to understand, I like every section to be
                    named and commented. As people tend to forget what they were doing so it better to nama every
                    section accordingly and I have named my sections,class, counters according to the semantics of my
                    HTML marked up content. I started my coding using HTML5 tags including DOCTYPE declaration, meta
                    tags, semantic elements and graphic elements such as svg to create animated vector based graphic. It
                    was my first time using graphic elements which was quite interesting discovering I could create an
                    animated arrow using svg and @keyframes. While writing HTML/CSS I was concentrating on coding
                    sections that float and layout perfectly, I messed up quite a few times but finally I fixed the
                    coding using the flex flow and wrap. However, I was mostly concerned about making the website
                    responsive to fit on mobile screen, setting viewport meta tag and adding screen media using HTML/CSS
                    to automatically resize, hide, shrink, and enlarge solved my problem.
                </p>

                <h4>Optimization</h4>
                <p>
                    To ensure my site loads fast I have optimised all my images to reduce the file size and compress the
                    images without losing huge amount of quality. Larger file sizes made my website speed slower and
                    every image would take a few seconds to load which resulted in my website loading for amount of time
                    after optimizing the images there was a great amount of change which also increased the speed of the
                    website. To compress JPEG files, I used two sites Squoosh and TintJPG both sites were free and fast
                    but squoosh was complicated and the end results did not satisfy me, on the other hand TintJPG was
                    simple and seemed more reliable. TinyJPG reduced the file size of my JPEG images, all the uploaded
                    images were analyzed and applied the best possible JPEG encoding. Based on the content of my images
                    an optimal strategy was chosen automatically, the result is a quality images without wasting storage
                    or bandwidth.

                    My main technical issues were to create a responsive site that fits on all the devices. for the
                    sections that did not work well with one or two layouts I have employed 3 layouts/ media screen
                    queries for different screen widths .
