                <h3>The Industry</h3>
               <p>
                Existence of being a woman in tech industry gives you all sorts of feelings innovative to lonely. This could be the one reason why I had to 
                question myself in the first year of my Website development course, I asked “Why am I doing the male based course? or why aren't there 
                enough females?”, I think the reason for these questions was clear because there were only 3 female fellow students including myself in a 
                course full of male students. Sometimes the gender split can make huge difference on your learning experience. 
                However, that didn’t stop me from undertaking what I wanted to achieve in fact It encouraged me, to feel proud and unique. Here I am now in 
                my final year completing my degree and I am looking forward to making changes in the tech industry by being the ‘tech woman’ and looking to 
                inspire the new generation. </p>

 <em class="attribution">Being a woman in the technology industry</em>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>My inspiration</h3>
                <p>During my second year I was inspired by successful females in technology industry
                    such as Laura Soutar, who is a Software Engineer, Civica Digital. As I searched up ‘Being woman in
                    the technology industry’ Laura’s blog showed
                    up where she has effectively written here story of being the woman in technology and how she has
                    made her way through and how that changed her
                    and how she sees the world. Laura say’s “we should highlight more women in the media and education
                    system so that they can act as role models”
                    (<a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/woman-in-the-technology/58755/">Open Access
                        Government</a>, 2019), here she is speaking on encouraging the women and women's rights in the
                    industry, more females we encourage to
                    take a step forward, more mentors we have for the young girls to be inspired and lead. Women's
                    rights in the industry like maternity leave and
                    financial support or a female wanting to start a family while continuing to work, these have small
                    changes have already taken part in many
                    countries which is good news but in the technology industry I believe we need to bring paternity
                    benefits up to scratch and this is my aim in
                    the industry development.</p>

                <h4>Industry statistic</h4>
                <p> 4.3 billion internet users Globally, approximately 1.94 billion active websites in the world, even
                    the small businesses have websites reached 64% in 2019, 66 percent of people prefer to read
                    beautifully designed content, mobile devices account for nearly 2 of every 3 minutes spent online
                    and 90% of people use multiple screens sequentially
                    (<a href="https://techjury.net/">Tech Jury</a>, 2019). All these facts are representing the
                    importance of website developers and designers in the tech industry. The industry is developing, and
                    we have a new generation stepping forward with great new ideas. 64% of the smaller business decided
                    to grow their business online by developing a website, of course the website makes a huge difference
                    to a business and many organizations started from a small online business to a worldwide known
                    manufacturer.

                </p>
                <em class="attribution">My future career</em>
                <p>As a website development student, I am looking forward to my future career in the Tech industry in
                    this country because the “UK tech scaleup investment makes up 80% of total tech investment in the
                    UK. This puts the UK in a strong international position to continue creating tech unicorns, and
                    driving job creation up through high growth company activity” (<a
                        href="https://technation.io/report2019/#11-scaleup-investment/">Tech Nation</a>, 2019).</p>
                <em class="attribution">Employment in the city</em>
                <p> According to the Tech Nation report “The recent growth rate for London tech scaleups at 56% makes
                    the cluster first in the world for scaleup growth”
                    (<a href="https://technation.io/report2019/#key-statistics">Tech Nation</a>, 2019). Which means
                    there is a higher chance for people living in London to get the positions and for people like myself
                    living in Manchester might have to move to London to achieve the success. This affects me as an
                    individual who is not planning to move out to another city as this could disturb my family life.
                    However, in the future approximately in few years I believe I can look up for a change in the
                    industrial growth rate in Manchester, because Manchester is a city of students and new talented
                    employees and graduates connected to technology industry will soon make the change, as we all are
                    striving for growth and success.
